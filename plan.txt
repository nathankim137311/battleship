// randomize ship locations 

using the ship's property of length, figure out a way to randomize ship locations. 

if the generated ship is horizontal, increment elements to the right by 1 times the length number.
add class list of ship name and class taken. 

if the gernerated ship is not horizontal, increment by 10 times the length number and add class
list of ship name and class taken. 

// conditionals 
    1. ships must not overlap one another 
    2. ships wrap to the next line of the grid
    2. only the last number of an array can have a zero in it ex. 10, 20, 30, 40, etc.

1. to solve this problem, there will be a conditional statement that checks the numbers of the 
ship array, and if one of the indexes (which correspond to grid div element) contains the class 
'taken' then the function is called back until that statement passes. This statement will check all 
5 ships. 

2. to solve this problem, there will be a conditional statement that checks all numbers of the ship
array and if a number other than the last index is divisible by 10 with no remainders then the 
function is repeated until that statment passes. 

at the end, you should be able to randomize the positions of all five ships on the grid.
